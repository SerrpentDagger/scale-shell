# Feathers and Flame

This setup combines the snappiness and good hardware support of CachyOS with the gorgeous minimalism of Niri and Noctalia Shell.
It's completely modular; you can either breeze through the install menu, pressing 'Yes' to get a cohesive and well-configured system to start off with, or you can pick through selectively to avoid your particular raisins.

## Installation

Installation takes the form of a single `curl` command in an appropriate fresh CachyOS install.

### of CachyOS

First, install CachyOS normally (from a flashed USB with [their iso](https://cachyos.org/download/)), subject to the following notes:
1. Select `Limine` as your bootloader. <img width="564" height="309" alt="limine bootloader selection" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/choose-limine.jpg" />
3. Encrypt your drive by selecting `btrfs` and `Encrypt System` in the `Partitions` section. <img width="564" height="309" alt="btrfs drive encryption" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/btrfs-encrypted-partitioning.jpg" />
4. Select `Niri` in the `Desktop` section.
5. You can uncheck Firefox in the `Packages` section, since Feathers can install Mullvad and Tor Browsers for you. <img width="1128" height="309" alt="package selection" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/package-selection.jpg" />
6. Choose the same password for your user login as you did for encryption. <img width="564" height="309" alt="login password same" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/login-details-same-password.jpg" />
7. Reboot!

Once you've booted into your basic installation, press `Mod+Return` to open a terminal and run:
`curl -fsSL https://serpentdagger.com/feathers-and-flame/install | bash`. You'll be greeted by a flashy owl: <img width="478" height="520" alt="feathers installer welcome" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/installer-welcome.jpg" />

Select the components you want, or just `Ctrl + A` for all of them!
<img width="478" height="520" alt="installer select components for install" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/installer-main-selection.jpg" />

You will be asked for confirmation before installing:
<img width="478" height="520" alt="installer confirm selection" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/installer-confirm-selection.jpg" />

After pressing `Yes`, the installer will take a while to download and configure the system for you, depending on your bandwidth and hardware. After it's done, you will be prompted to reboot:
<img width="478" height="520" alt="installer finished reboot prompt" src="https://serpentdagger.com/assets/images/feathers-and-flame/installer-finished-reboot.jpg" />

Once you've rebooted again, Feathers and Flame is ready for your enjoyment! I hope you have as great a time using it as I did setting it up!

### Trouble?

The installer keeps track of what components have been finished successfully, so if something goes wrong mid-install you can continue where you left off, or try again, by re-running the installer with `bash ~/.local/share/feathers-and-flame/install.sh`. It will ask if you want to pick up where you left off, or give you the opportunity to skip a component if it doesn't seem to work for some reason. This is also used later in the update script to avoid refreshing or installing unselected components on update.
